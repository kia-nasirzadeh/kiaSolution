I think that in my behavior and personality and in my dealings with people, i have signs of "Behavioral Weaknesses", i think they don't take me as seriously as I want and my personality is not strong and alpha enough.
let me give you some examples:
1- I loaned my car to one of the car dealers for sale, my expectation is that every time I call, he will answer me quickly, but this does not happen.
2- I went to a translation company of one of my friends to translate my documents. When I went and gave the documents, he treated me with respect and kindness at all stages. but he did not come out of his room to say hello and express politeness when i wanted to take back my documents

In general, I try to be less in groups because I am afraid that they maybe pulling my legs or some kind of bullshitting me or some kind of not respecting me by not taking me serious enough or they may talk over me
I also try to call my business colleagues less because I am afraid that I will be taken less seriously if I call more.

All that aside, I feel like I'm not attractive enough to others, I mean some characters are like that, people try to relate to them more, but I'm not like that and for the majority of the relationships that I had especially with the same sex(gender) and with my normal friends or colleagues, I think that I always I paid the ransom in some way so that they would keep their relationship with me, I mean by "ransom" that I tried to count the dinner or make the entertainment plans
