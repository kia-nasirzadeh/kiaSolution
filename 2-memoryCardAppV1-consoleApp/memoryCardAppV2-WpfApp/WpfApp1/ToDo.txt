1- application doesn't close with cross sign, the operation still is open in task manager
2- next beside last flashCard, aslo next flash card should be ready for fast paging
3- pictures plugin using url (remote hosted pics)
4- lyrics plugin using url (remote hosted songs)
5- skip button
6- paging in main page
7- scroller for answer place
8- changing parts with auto save for next use
9- automatic pdf builder of the questions that you coudn't answer performed using 53 instead of 3
10- flashCards shouldn't been deleted after they reach the end, they should moved to another table, so you can find them with searching your database
11- if you delete a flashCard after ending reach, then you want to use "see the latest flashCard button" application crashes and blows up
12- BUG-FOUND -> making new flash card will make empty flash card!

i opened table manager
in fc-questioner i pressed 4 and copied sth
i ended up making new flash card while (4 is open from last step)
i pressed save
and bug!, nothing happened
